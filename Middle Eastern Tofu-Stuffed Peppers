Recipe By : Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites, page 246

2 teaspoons canola or other vegetable oil
2 large garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
1 1/2 cups diced onions
1 pinch cayenne
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 2/3 cups peeled and diced carrots
1 dash salt
1 cup diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups grated frozen tofu (12-ounce cake)
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill (1 teaspoon dried)
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup couscous
1/4 cup hot water
3 tablespoons currants or raisins
4 large bell peppers
2 cups tomato juice

 

Serves 4. 
Preparation time: 30 minutes, once the tofu is frozen and thawed. 
Baking time: 45 to 50 minutes.

 

Warm the oil in a medium saucepan, add the garlic, onions, cayenne, and
cinnamon, and saute for 3 minutes. 

Add the carrots, sprinkle with salt, cover, and cook for 3 minutes. 

Add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes, until the carrots are just tender. 

Stir in the tofu, soy sauce, dill, lemon juice, couscous, and water and cook 
on low to medium heat for 2 minutes, stirring often. 

Cover tightly, remove from the heat, and set aside. 

After about 5 minutes, add the currants or raisins and adjust the seasonings 
if necessary.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Cut the peppers in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds but leave the stem
ends on so that the peppers will hold their shape during baking. Fill each
pepper half with about 1/2 cup of filling and place it in a nonreactive
baking dish. 

Pour the tomato juice into the bottom of the baking dish, cover tightly, 
and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the peppers are tender.

Freezing Tofu (page 419): Thawed frozen tofu has a chewy texture. We use
it in chili, cabbage rolls and other dishes that traditionally use meat.
To freeze, arrange the cakes of tofu on a plate or baking sheet and freeze
for 4 to 6 hours. Transfer the frozen tofu to the refrigerator and thaw
for 10 to 12 hours. If thawing is not complete when you are ready to cook,
complete the process either by baking the tofu, covered, at 350 F for 15 to
20 minutes or by zapping it for 5 minutes in a microwave. When the tofu is
thawed, squeeze out as much water as possible, like you would a sponge.
Don't worry about mangling it. Once squeezed, the tofu should be crumbled,
shredded, or grated for use.


These peppers are especially delicious served on a bed of rice and topped 
with Chunky Tomato Sauce and a sprinkling of grated feta cheese.

MENU SUGGESTIONS: Serve with cucumber slices topped with Yogurt Tahini
Dressing and Seasoned Steamed Artichokes. End with Lemon Pudding Cake.
