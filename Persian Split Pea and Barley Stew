1⁄2 cup raw barley
1 bay leaf
1 garlic clove
4 cups water
1 cup dried split yellow peas
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 cup onion, chopped
1 cup carrot, peeled and cut in 1 inch chunks
2 cups potatoes, cut in 1 inch chunks
1 1⁄2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch cayenne
2 cups vegetable broth
2 cups tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1⁄4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 lemon, juice of
salt and pepper

1/2 cup nonfat yogurt
2 mincd small garlic cloves
salt

toasted pine nuts
lemon wedges

In a medium saucepan, bring the barley, bay leaf, garlic and 2 cups of water to a boil.
Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

Add the split peas, cardamom, cinnamon and the remaining water and simmer, covered for 
another 45 minutes, or until the barley and split peas are soft and most of the liquid 
has absorbed. Stir occasionally and, if necessary, add a small amount of additional water 
to prevent the mixture from sticking.

While the barley and split peas are cooking, place the onions, carrots, potatoes, salt, 
cayenne, and stock in a large saucepan.

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 10 minutes.

Stir in the tomatoes and continue to simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes, until the 
vegetables are tender.

Add the cooked barley and split peas. Stir in the parsley, lemon juice, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Discard the bay leaf.

If desired, combine the garlic yogurt ingredients in a small bowl. Sprincle on a few
toasted pine nuts and serve with several lemon wedges or a dollop of garlic yogurt.
