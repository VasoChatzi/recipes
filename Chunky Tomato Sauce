Chunky Tomato Sauce

Recipe By : Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites, page 351

1 medium onion -- chopped (about 1 cup)
2 cloves garlic -- minced or pressed (up to 3)
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 1/2 cups undrained canned tomatoes (28 ounce can)
2 teaspoons dried basil OR 2 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano OR 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and black pepper -- to taste

Makes 3 cups. Total time: 25 minutes.

  

In a heavy, nonreactive pan, saute the onions and garlic in the oil for
about 10 minutes on medium heat, until translucent. Stir often to prevent
sticking. 

Drain the tomato juice into the sauteing onions. With a knife, chop the 
tomatoes right in the can and add them to the onions, or use your hands 
to squeeze them directly into the cooking pan. Stir in the basil, oregano, 
and parsley. 

Simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Add 
salt and pepper to taste.


NOTES : Because this is such a useful all-purpose sauce, you may want to
double the recipe - but no need to double the oil. The 2 teaspoons will be
enough! Tightly sealed, it will keep refrigerated for at least a week and
frozen for several months.
